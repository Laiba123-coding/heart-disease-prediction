# ❤ Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on their medical data using **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** models.  
It uses the **Heart Disease UCI Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset) and performs full data cleaning, EDA, model training, and evaluation.


## 🎯 Objective
Predict heart disease risk using medical data.
Train and compare models like Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.
Visualize feature importance to understand the factors influencing predictions.
